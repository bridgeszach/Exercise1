    <h3 id=id2>Hello, my name is Zach and here are a few tidbits of information about me:</h3>
    <p>I am a former Interior Communications Specialist with the United States Navy. <br> I am married and have a 2 year
        old daughter named Hadley. <br> I have been working with Python
        data science and analytics for almost 4 years now. Mostly self taught with the Python documentation and
        tutorial.<br> I am more of a mountain vacation person than the beach. After living on Coronado Island and a
        highly deployed ship, I have grown tired of the water. <br> Hobbies include: Chasing a 2 year old, playing
        guitar, grilling, and fishing.<sub>drinking</sub><br>
        <b>My goals for this class are to start a career in software development and to
            truly understand how the entire pipeline of development to deployment works. I look forward to continuing in
            the class!</b>
